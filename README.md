# What is KeyAll?

KeyAll is (going to be) a open-souce, highly customizable all-in-one solution for manipulating and interacting with applications and Windows all without the mouse. Efficiency is the name of the game, the less you need to touch the mouse the better.

Komorebi is great and all, but let's combine all the best efficiency softwares into one open-source portable package.

## Roadmap

We are looking to implement the following into this project:

- Show all visible interactable elements on-screen with a keystroke
- Simulate any mouse input on selected element
- Customize what elements are shown, keystrokes, and themes
- Snap and rearrange windows to customizable and flexible locations
